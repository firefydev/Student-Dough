Student Dough

Having a difficult time keeping track of student expenses and daily spending? Use this accessible and interactive tool to stay up-to-date on latest student deals and track your own personal finances!

The primary resources used were Visual Studio Code, Github, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and BootStrap. These tools were very efficient in demonstrating the product idea and displaying an interactive user interface that allows easy accessibility.

## Inspiration
As a university student, there are so many aspects in life to juggle such as school, clubs, food, shopping, and many other things that have one common pattern: Money! Whether it is required textbooks, or meals at a restaurant, there is always money involved and most finance trackers may not always be easily accessible or efficient to use. That's why we created StudentDough, a budget tracker in your pocket. 

## What it does
StudentDough is a web application that provides students with the latest, hottest, student deals and discounts, along with an added bonus of a budget tracker where students can personally set goals. They can create multiple buckets of how they wish to spilt their finances and add and remove expenses relating to each bucket. 

## How we built it
This was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and BootStrap, on the VS Code platform.

## What's next for StudentDough
We hope to advance our student discount deals section to include improved real-time data updates and expand provided resources on our application.
